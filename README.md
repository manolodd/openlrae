# THE PROJECT

<b>OpenLRAE</b> is a Licensing Risks Analysis Engine, multiplatform and mutilanguage. It's a java library that allow knowing the risk induced by the bill of components you have included in your project, the way they are bound, the kind of distribution you're going to do of your project, and so on.

After decades working in public and private and academic sector, assesing hundreds of platforms from an Opensource perspective I realized that most of the existing tools try to detect the components that have been included in a project and, then, they try to infer their licenses. Only after that (that brings a lots of false positives and a lot of false negatives) a license analysis is done.

This approach part from the point of view that a development team doesn't know and control the bill of components of their projects, and are not beware of the licensing risks their use imply.

Also, there are lots of potential risks derived from licensing; not only licensing incompatibilities but maintenance risks, risks in bussiness terms, etc.

OpenLRAE approach is that developement teams have to know the bill of components they're using, their versions, their licenses and all kind of things related to the use of third parties components in their own projects.

With this kind of knowledge, teams are able to use OpenLRAE to get a dashboard of licensing risks that can help them in decission making.

```console
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.manolodominguez</groupId>
  <artifactId>openlrae</artifactId>
  <version>0.3</version>
</dependency>
```

# COMPILING FROM SOURCES

If you want to test new features (please, do it and give feedback), you will need to compile the project from sources. Follow these steps:

 - Clone the OpenLRAE repo: 
```console
git clone https://github.com/manolodd/openlrae.git
```
 - Compile the code and obtain a binary jar including all you need (you will need to install Maven before):
```console
cd openlrae
mvn package
```
 - The jar file will be located in "target" directory.
```console
cd target
```
- Now, pick te artifact you need:
```console
openlrae-{YourVersion}.jar
```
if you are going to use a project builder in your project (maven, graddle) that will supply dependencies at compile time, or
```console
openlrae-{YourVersion}-with-dependencies.jar
```
If you want openlrae and all its dependencies in a bundle.

You can also run the latter to do some things: to know wich things are supported in the librery, to run a built-in risk analysis, etc.
```console
java -jar openlrae-{YourVersion}-with-dependencies.jar
```
