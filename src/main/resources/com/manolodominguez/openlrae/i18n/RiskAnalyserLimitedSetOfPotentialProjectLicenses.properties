BEWARE_THAT_BLAH=Beware that in order to use
AS_A_PROJECT_LICENSE_BLAH=as a project license, you have to have written permission from the copyright holder of
TO_INCLUDE_THIS_BLAH=to include this component in a project licensed under
THAT=that
TRY_TO_REPLACE=Try to replace
BY_A_COMPONENT_WITH_BLAH=by a component with other license natively compatible with a project licensed under
COULD_NOT_BE_USED_BLAH=could not be used as project license because of
THAT_IS_INCOMPATIBLE_BLAH=that is incompatible with a project licensed under
BY_A_COMPONENT_WITH_BLAH_2=by another component with a license compatible with a project licensed under
THAT_IS_NOT_KNOWN_BLAH=that is not known to be compatible with a project released under
BY_A_COMPONENT_WITH_BLAH_3=by a component with other license known to be compatible with a project licensed under
ALTHOUGH=Although
BY_A_COMPONENT_WITH_BLAH_4=by a component with a supported license if you want to analyse the project with OpenLRAE and know whether the component would be compatible with a project released under
OR_NOT=or not
WHOSE_LICENSE_BLAH=whose license is not supported by OpenLRAE and cannot be analysed. Therefore, this is handled as to be incompatible  with a project released under
WE_APOLOGIZE_BLAH=We apologize for the inconvenience.
IS_HANDLED_AS_BLAH=is handled as incompatible by default because its license is not supported by OpenLRAE, perhaps it could be used as project license once OpenLRAE knows how to analyse this license. We apologize for the inconvenience.
COULD_NOT_BE_USED_BLAH_2=could not be used as project license, at least without a deep analysis because of
WHOSE_LICENSE_IS_BLAH=whose license is compatible with a project released under
EXCEPT_UNDER_BLAH=except under certain circumstances.
CARRY_OUT_A_DEEP_BLAH=Carry out a deep analysis to be sure that your specific case is not one of the exceptions in wich
IS_INCOMPATIBLE_WITH_BLAH=is incompatible with a project released under
BEFORE_CHOOSING_BLAH=before choosing that license for the project.
BY_A_COMPONENT_WITH_BLAH_5=by a component with a license fully compatible with a project licensed under
WHOSE_LICENSE_IS_BLAH_2=whose license is incompatible with a project released under
CARRY_OUT_A_DEEP_BLAH_2=Carry out a deep analysis to be sure that your specific case is one of the exceptions in wich
IS_COMPATIBLE_WITH_BLAH=is compatible with a project released under
COULD_BE_USED_AS_BLAH=could be used as project license because all components licenses of the project (and their respective linkage type) are compatible with a project released under
NONE_OF_THE_BLAH=None of the licenses supported by OpenLRAE could be used as project license because there are incompatibilities with project licenses in all cases. At least without a deep analysis of your specific case.
GENERAL_TIP_1=General tip: try not to link component statically in your project as it is more likely to have incompatibilities.
GENERAL_TIP_2=General tip: try not to include a derivative work of a component under a different license than the original component as it is more likely to have incompatibilities.
GENERAL_TIP_3=General tip: try to use components with permisive licenses as it is more problable not to have licensing risks.
GENERAL_TIP_4=General tip: try not to use components released under an undefined license because from a legal point of view this is the same than the most restrictive license (all right reserved). Not having a defined license is not the same as released to public domain. The latter has to be declared explicitly.
GENERAL_TIP_5=General tip: when modifying the project bill of components to reduce the exposure to this risks, start changing components that are root causes in more cases.
GENERAL_TIP_6=General tip: when modifying the project bill of components to reduce the exposure to this risks, start with those with higher level of contribution to the overall project.
GENERAL_TIP_7=General tip: if you own all right on a given risky component, try changing its license instead of looking for another component.
GENERAL_TIP_8=General tip: try not to use more than a license for the project unless completely necessary. It makes very difficult to include new components in the project as their licenses have to be compatible with all project licenses simultaneously.
